<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Downpipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catted</li><li>Catless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle downpipe market primarily consists of two types: catted and catless downpipes. Catted downpipes include a catalytic converter, which helps reduce harmful emissions, making them suitable for emission-compliant vehicles. They offer a balance between performance enhancement and regulatory adherence. Catless downpipes, on the other hand, eliminate the catalytic converter, providing maximum exhaust flow and performance gains, often sought by enthusiasts for racing or performance applications. However, they may not meet legal emissions standards.</p></p>
