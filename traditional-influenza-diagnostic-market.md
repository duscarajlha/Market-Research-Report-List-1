<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Traditional influenza diagnostic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rapid Influenza Detection Tests</li><li>Viral Culture</li><li>Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) Tests</li><li>Serological Assays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The traditional influenza diagnostic market comprises several testing methods. Rapid influenza detection tests provide quick results by detecting viral antigens, making them ideal for immediate diagnosis. Viral culture involves growing the virus from patient samples, offering high specificity but requiring longer turnaround times. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests identify viral antigens in respiratory specimens using fluorescent labeling, providing faster results than culture. Serological assays detect antibodies in the blood, indicating previous infection but are less useful for acute diagnosis.</p></p>
