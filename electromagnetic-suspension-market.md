<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electromagnetic Suspension Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pure Active Suspension</li><li>Semi-Active Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electromagnetic suspension systems can be categorized into two main types: pure active suspension and semi-active suspension. Pure active suspension utilizes sensors and actuators to actively adjust the suspension dynamics in real-time, providing optimal ride comfort and stability by responding instantaneously to road conditions. In contrast, semi-active suspension systems adjust the damping characteristics using controlled mechanisms but do not actively change the suspension setup itself. Both systems aim to enhance vehicle handling, comfort, and safety through varying levels of dynamic response.</p></p>
