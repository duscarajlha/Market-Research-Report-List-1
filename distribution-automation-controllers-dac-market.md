<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distribution Automation Controllers (DAC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distributed Type</li><li>Centralized Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distribution Automation Controllers (DAC) manage and optimize electric distribution systems. The market is categorized into two types: distributed and centralized. In a distributed type, multiple controllers operate independently across the grid, enhancing reliability and resilience by localizing decision-making. Conversely, the centralized type consolidates control functions at a single point, streamlining management and data processing for efficiency but may reduce flexibility. Both approaches aim to improve grid performance, enhance monitoring, and facilitate faster response to outages.</p></p>
